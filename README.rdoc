= Knife CFN

= DESCRIPTION:

This is a Knife plugin for AWS Cloud Formation. This plugin gives knife the ability to validate, create, describe, and delete stacks.

= INSTALLATION:

Be sure you are running the latest version Chef. Versions earlier than 0.10.0 don't support plugins:

    gem install chef

This plugin is distributed as a Ruby Gem. To install it, run:

    gem install knife-cfn

Depending on your system's configuration, you may need to run this command with root privileges.

= CONFIGURATION:

In order to communicate with the Amazon's CloudFormation API you will have to tell Knife about your AWS Access Key and Secret Access Key.  The easiest way to accomplish this is to create some entries in your <tt>knife.rb</tt> file:

    knife[:aws_access_key_id]  = "Your AWS Access Key ID"
    knife[:aws_secret_access_key] = "Your AWS Secret Access Key"

If your knife.rb file will be checked into a SCM system (ie readable by others) you may want to read the values from environment variables:

    knife[:aws_access_key_id] = "#{ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID']}"
    knife[:aws_secret_access_key] = "#{ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']}"

You also have the option of passing your AWS API Key/Secret into the individual knife subcommands using the <tt>-A</tt> (or <tt>--aws-access-key-id</tt>) <tt>-K</tt> (or <tt>--aws-secret-access-key</tt>) command options

    # provision a new stack
    knife cfn create test -f test.stack 


= SUBCOMMANDS:

This plugin provides the following Knife subcommands.  Specific command options can be found by invoking the subcommand with a <tt>--help</tt> flag

== knife cfn validate
